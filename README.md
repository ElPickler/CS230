    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was a company named The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room had developed a small Android game named Draw It or Lose It, and were looking to expand their market to include personal computers. 

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I would like to think that I did a good job nailing down the design contraints and understanding some of the difficulties that this project will need to overcome. 

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

In particular, the UML Class diagram is incredibly helpful for understanding and structuring the code as you develop it. I find it to be a useful frame of reference to fall back on regularly. 

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In retrospect, my evaluation could stand to use not only more precise detail, but is woefully missing citations. This detail in particular took me a very long time to begin to correct. 

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I felt it was important to consider that the game has an established audience on Android who might be frustrated if their experience was made worse due to this update. For this reason, I chose to emphasize points where the Android user experience might be preserved. No two projects are exactly alike, and these differences can dramatically affect the best way to approach a project, not just for the client, but also for the developer. 

    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

It is important to first understand the needs of the client. These needs will inform the priorities of the project, as well as help you plan the underlying archetecture.
